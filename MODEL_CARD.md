### Out-of-Scope Use

This model should NOT be used for:
- Medical, legal, or financial advice
- Generating harmful, toxic, or biased content
- Impersonating specific real individuals
- Producing academic work without proper attribution
- Any application requiring factual accuracy without verification

## Bias, Risks, and Limitations

### Known Limitations

1. **Training Data Bias**: The model reflects biases present in the training literature
2. **Factual Accuracy**: Not trained for factual tasks; may generate plausible but incorrect information
3. **Context Length**: Limited to the base model's context window (~8k tokens for Llama 3.2)
4. **Style Specificity**: Most effective for generating text similar to training material
5. **Language**: Primarily trained on English text

### Risks

- **Copyright Concerns**: Generated text may inadvertently reproduce training data
- **Harmful Content**: Despite instruction tuning, may generate inappropriate content
- **Over-reliance**: Users should not rely solely on model outputs for critical decisions
- **Hallucination**: May generate confident but false information

### Recommendations

Users should:
- Review and edit all generated content
- Add appropriate disclaimers for AI-generated text
- Not use for high-stakes decisions without human oversight
- Be aware of potential copyright issues
- Test thoroughly for their specific use case

## Training Details

### Training Data

## How to Use

### Loading the Model

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM
from peft import PeftModel

# Load base model
base_model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    "meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct",
    device_map="auto",
    trust_remote_code=True
)

# Load LoRA adapter
model = PeftModel.from_pretrained(base_model, "a-01a/novelCrafter")

# Load tokenizer
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("a-01a/novelCrafter")
```

### Generating Text

```python
# Prepare input
prompt = "Once upon a time, in a distant land,"
inputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="pt").to(model.device)

# Generate
outputs = model.generate(
    **inputs,
    max_new_tokens=200,
    temperature=0.7,
    top_p=0.9,
    do_sample=True,
    repetition_penalty=1.1
)

# Decode
generated_text = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
print(generated_text)
```

### Inference Parameters

Recommended generation parameters:
```python
max_new_tokens = 100-500      # Length of generation
temperature = 0.7-0.9         # Creativity (lower = more focused)
top_p = 0.9                   # Nucleus sampling
top_k = 50                    # Top-k sampling
repetition_penalty = 1.1-1.2  # Prevent repetition
do_sample = True              # Enable sampling
```
